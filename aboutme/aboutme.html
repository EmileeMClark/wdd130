    <h2>Emilee Clark</h2>
    <p>Hello my name is Emilee and my family and I currently live in Colorado Springs, CO. My husband and I have been married for 12 years and we have 4 little girls (ages 10, 9, 6,4). I am studying Applied Technology and plan to graduate in the Spring of 2024. This is my first web development class and to be honest, I am equal parts nervous and excited. My goal is to be able to work from home, and be able to attend my kids activities that they will participate in as they grow. I also really want to learn something that is applicable to today's workforce, and I figured the more tech oriented the world gets, the better it will be for me to learn some web development and coding skills. I am thrilled to be here!<p>
    <p>Some fun things about me: I love to hike. There is a trail here called the Incline. It is famous for gaining 2000 feet in elevation in .88 miles. It follows over 2000 steps straight up an old cograil up a mountain. Once at the top, you take a 4 mile trail back down. I love the physical challenge and love being outdoors. It is my therapy. I am also an avid crocheter. There is a lot of yarn at my house. In fact, my husband built some really cool hexagon shelves to store my yarn on the wall. It makes for some great conversation starters as you enter our home.<p>
    <p>I joined the church 11 years ago. My husband baptized me while I was pregnant with our first little girl. It was a surreal experience. I am grateful for the gospel in my life, eventhough it can be a hard path at times. It has not been easy with my family, but it is amazing to see how far my mom and I have come over the last decade. My mom loves to hear my kids primary talks, and is very supportive, as opposed to 11 years ago. I sure am grateful for the Gospel of Jesus Christ. My favorite quote is one that my husband taught me back in high school. President Monson said, "Never let a problem to be solved become more important than a person to be loved." </p>
    <p>I am very much looking forward to getting to know you all, and working with you this semester!</p>
