    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this Rafting Co. website is to convince people to buy adventures through this company. This website will prove that we are the safest, most fun, adventurous company out there. It will show that we are here for our clients, and care about our clients while out in the backcountry. This website will show our clients that we are professional by displaying a simple, user-friendly layout, and by showing professional photos.</p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>The Rafting Co. audience is most likely within the age range of 20-60 years old. These customers will be financially stable enough to be able to provide the means to pay for a white water rafting excursion for themselves, and possibly other family members. Their interests will be along the lines of outdoor adventures, and taking some risks to have fun. The audience will expect to see a thorough description on the site of what is needed of them, what is provided by the company, what to expect in terms of payment and, of course, what to expect on the excursion itself. The audience will most likely be accessing this site either on a laptop, or a mobile device.</p>
